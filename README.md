# hello-calculator
A simple Java calculator built wth netbeans.

IDE: Netbeans

Okay, so I took these secondary school students Java - on how to build a simple calculator and I have decided share the code here.

It was an exciting experience to see how passionate they were to learn. How they grasped everything thought and some went extra miles in customizing the look and feel.
